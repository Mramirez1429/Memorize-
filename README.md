# Memorize-
This is a project that uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The project is a matching card game. One must memorize where each card is to matchit up with its pair. I used JavaScript as I had prior exprience with it. This was the first time I used HTML and CSS. I kept the desing simple the start Screen gets its own HTML and css files. As well as the each level. There is ine JavaScript file which ruins the logic of the game. Keep everything on its own file so finding bugs wont be an issue when trying to fix them.
